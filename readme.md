# Ocean Wise Label Misuse Viewer

This project has been built for VanHacks2018. It is intended to serve Ocean Wise organization. 

Ocean Wise labels are being misused, and the reporting methods Ocean Wise uses are outdated. We have come up with a system that allows individuals who notices label misuses to take pictures with their phone, and send the data to our backend through a mobile application. We then display this data on a map in a web application, for Ocean Wise, or anyone who would like to view the Ocean Wise label violations.
